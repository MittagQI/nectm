/**
 * This method is like `_.union` except that it accepts `comparator` which
 * is invoked to compare elements of `arrays`. Result values are chosen from
 * the first array in which the value occurs. The comparator is invoked
 * with two arguments: (arrVal, othVal).

 * @category Array
 * @param {...Array} [arrays] The arrays to inspect.
 * @param {Function} [comparator] The comparator invoked per element.
 * @returns {Array} Returns the new array of combined values.
 * @example
 *
 * var objects = [{ 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }, { 'x': 2, 'y': 1 }];
 * var others = [{ 'x': 1, 'y': 1 }, { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }];
