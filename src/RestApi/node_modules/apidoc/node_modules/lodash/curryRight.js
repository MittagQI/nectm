 * This method is like `_.curry` except that arguments are applied to `func`
 * in the manner of `_.partialRight` instead of `_.partial`.
 *
 * The `_.curryRight.placeholder` value, which defaults to `_` in monolithic
 * builds, may be used as a placeholder for provided arguments.
 *
 * **Note:** This method doesn't set the "length" property of curried functions.
 *
 * @static
 * @memberOf _
 * @since 3.0.0
 * @category Function
 * @param {Function} func The function to curry.
 * @param {number} [arity=func.length] The arity of `func`.
 * @param- {Object} [guard] Enables use as an iteratee for methods like `_.map`.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new curried function.
 * @example
 *
 * var abc = function(a, b, c) {
 *   return [a, b, c];
 * };
 *
 * var curried = _.curryRight(abc);
 *
 * curried(3)(2)(1);
 * // => [1, 2, 3]
 *
 * curried(2, 3)(1);
 * // => [1, 2, 3]
 *
 * curried(1, 2, 3);
 * // => [1, 2, 3]
