/**
 * This method is like `_.assign` except that it recursively merges own and
 * inherited enumerable string keyed properties of source objects into the
 * destination object. Source properties that resolve to `undefined` are
 * skipped if a destination value exists. Array and plain object properties
 * are merged recursively. Other objects and value types are overridden by
 * assignment. Source objects are applied from left to right. Subsequent
 * sources overwrite property assignments of previous sources.
 *
 * **Note:** This method mutates `object`.

 * @memberOf _
 * @since 0.5.0
 * @category Object
 * @param {Object} object The destination object.
 * @param {...Object} [sources] The source objects.
 * @returns {Object} Returns `object`.
 * @example
 *
 * var object = {
 *   'a': [{ 'b': 2 }, { 'd': 4 }]
 * };

 * var other = {
