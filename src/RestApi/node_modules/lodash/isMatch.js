 * Performs a partial deep comparison between `object` and `source` to

 * **Note:** This method is equivalent to `_.matches` when `source` is
 * partially applied.
 *
 * Partial comparisons will match empty array and empty object `source`
 * values against any array or object value, respectively. See `_.isEqual`
 * for a list of supported value comparisons.
