/**
 * Creates a function that performs a partial deep comparison between a given
 * object and `source`, returning `true` if the given object has equivalent
 * property values, else `false`.
 *
 * **Note:** The created function is equivalent to `_.isMatch` with `source`
 * partially applied.
 *
 * Partial comparisons will match empty array and empty object `source`
 * values against any array or object value, respectively. See `_.isEqual`
 * for a list of supported value comparisons.
