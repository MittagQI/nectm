 * Creates a function that invokes `func` with `partials` prepended to the

 * alter the `this` binding.
 *
 * The `_.partial.placeholder` value, which defaults to `_` in monolithic
 * builds, may be used as a placeholder for partially applied arguments.
 *
 * **Note:** This method doesn't set the "length" property of partially
