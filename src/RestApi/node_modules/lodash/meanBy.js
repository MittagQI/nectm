/**
 * This method is like `_.mean` except that it accepts `iteratee` which is

 * @param {Array} array The array to iterate over.
 * @param {Function} [iteratee=_.identity] The iteratee invoked per element.
 * @returns {number} Returns the mean.
 * @example
 *
 * var objects = [{ 'n': 4 }, { 'n': 2 }, { 'n': 8 }, { 'n': 6 }];
 *
 * _.meanBy(objects, function(o) { return o.n; });
