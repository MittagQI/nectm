 * @param {Array|Iterable|Object} coll - A collection to iterate over.
 * @param {AsyncFunction} iteratee - A function to apply to each item in `coll`,
 * which should use an array as its result. Invoked with (item, callback).
 * @param {Function} [callback(err)] - A callback which is called after all the
